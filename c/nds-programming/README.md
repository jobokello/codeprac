# Network & Distributed Programming
The following repository contains C code for docirculant(), TCP communication, UDP communication, process fork, interprocess communication - using pipes, shared memory & message queues - and signal handling.

### Running the algorithms
The following instructions assume you are using a Linux distro.

###### Make sure you have installed the build-essential package on your computer
To do this, run the following command in your command line:

```
sudo apt install build-essential
```

###### Executing the code
Once you have made sure that you have the build-essential package installed, change your working directory to the location of this repository.

In your command line, run the command below to build & compile each of the C programs:

```
gcc [file-name].c -o [file-name]
```

The above command will create an executable object called <em>[file-name]</em>. To execute the object file in your command line, run the command below:

```
./[file-name]
```

### Notes
The following programms were developed for the Network & Distributed Programming lecture.
